## 🔍 SEO & Favicon Optimization Guidelines

To ensure the website is fully indexable and ranked highly under keywords like `dhaka college international hall wbsite`, `dc hall website`, `adib dchall`, `international hall info`, and `hostel`, we have integrated a dedicated SEO and favicon system:

### 1. Favicon Search Result Requirements
Google and other search engines require specific formats for favicons to show up in search results:
- **Multiple Sizes**: Declared in all HTML headers for multiple square resolutions (192x192, 96x96, 48x48, 32x32, 16x16) along with Apple touch icons (180x180). This complies with Google's guidelines that favicons must be a multiple of 48px square.
- **Source Image**: The official building image is located at `images/logo.png`. Overwriting this file automatically updates the favicon and logo everywhere.

### 2. Search Keywords & Metadata
- **Meta Tags**: All HTML templates (`index.html`, `embed.html`, etc.) contain specific description and keyword tags targeting: `dhaka college international hall wbsite`, `dc hall website`, `adib dchall`, `international hall info`, `hostel`.
- **JSON-LD Schema**: Embedded structured JSON-LD organization markup in `index.html` to help Google index alternative search synonyms.

### 3. Automated SEO Script
If you add new HTML pages to the project and want to apply these meta and favicon settings instantly, run:
```bash
python scripts/seo-update.py
```

### 4. Indexing & Discovery
- **`robots.txt`**: Located in the root directory to allow crawlers to index the site and point to the sitemap.
- **`sitemap.xml`**: Maps and indexes all HTML pages so Google can discover them immediately.
